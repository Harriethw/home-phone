# How to build your own DIY telephone server

## Introduction - why do this?

This is a quick beginner's guide to get up and running with self-hosting your
own telephone server - using free, open source, software.

Although there are many third-party tools and products to help you do this, if you are the type of person that likes making (and breaking!) things, or learning more about how something is made, or maybe you have a very specific vision for a project and a tight budget, then it's worth spending some time learning about self hosting!

### Things you could build

- Your own voicemail centre
- A telephone exchange for a small business or organisation
- Art projects that incorporate sound and/or branching narratives
- A telephone line for news or announcements that you want to share with your community

And, once you get more advanced

- [Sending SMS for free across the world](https://github.com/MatejKovacic/RasPBX-install)

## Things you'll need for this guide

### Time

- Approx 1-3 hours in total, including down time while you wait for stuff to download

### Hardware

1. Broadband and an ethernet cable to plug into your modem - it will work over WiFi but service may drop out randomly as WiFi doesn't provide a consistent signal
1. A Raspberry Pi. I'm using a Raspberry Pi 3B for this
1. A Raspberry Pi power cable and plug - I'd recommend going for the official
   one as I've tried with other cables before and the power source wasn't consistent enough
1. A micro SD card that fits the Pi. Needs to be at least 8GB - I'm using a 32GB Amazon basics one.
1. A laptop to configure your server and download the OS
1. An SD card slot or adapter to put your SD card into your laptop

### Software

1. [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)
1. If you don't already have your own telephone line, an account with a telephone provider - this will cost around Â£6 a month, [I use voipfone](https://www.voipfone.co.uk/support/guides/pbx-services/third-party-pbx/freepbx)
